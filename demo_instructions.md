### Demo Script

**[0:00-0:15] Introduction**
```
"Hi! I'm demonstrating my Research Paper Summarizer that uses LoRA fine-tuning 
to analyze academic papers and generate summaries, glossaries, and exam questions."
```

**[0:15-0:30] Upload Paper**
- Open Streamlit interface
- Upload sample PDF
- Show PDF preview in left panel

```
"I'll upload this machine learning research paper. The interface shows a split-screen 
with PDF preview on the left and analysis results on the right."
```

**[0:30-0:50] Generate Analysis**
- Toggle "Use LoRA Adapter" ON
- Select model (show dropdown)
- Click "Analyze Paper"
- Show processing indicator

```
"I'm enabling my fine-tuned LoRA adapter and running the analysis. 
The model extracts key content and processes it through three specialized tasks."
```

**[0:50-1:30] Show Results**
- Navigate through Summary tab
- Switch to Glossary tab
- Review Questions tab
- Highlight one MCQ example

```
"Here's the 5-point summary capturing the main contributions. 
The glossary defines technical terms like 'transformer architecture'. 
And here are exam questions including this multiple choice about attention mechanisms."
```

**[1:30-1:45] Evaluation & Export**
- Show evaluation metrics
- Click "Download Report"
- Mention training process

```
"The system provides ROUGE and BERTScore evaluation metrics. 
I can export everything as a PDF report. The LoRA adapter was trained 
on academic paper data using PEFT for efficient fine-tuning."
