# Research Paper Summarizer - Data and Training Report

## Dataset Overview

### Data Sources and Collection

The training dataset consists of 20 carefully curated examples covering three primary tasks for research paper analysis:

- **Summarization**: 8 examples (40%)
- **Glossary Generation**: 6 examples (30%)
- **Question Generation**: 6 examples (30%)

Each example follows the instruction-input-response format commonly used in language model fine-tuning, specifically designed for academic text analysis tasks.

### Dataset Structure

**Format**: JSONL (JSON Lines) with three key fields:
- `instruction`: Task description and requirements
- `input`: Research paper excerpt or context (50-300 words)
- `response`: Expected output following task-specific formatting

**Example Record**:
```json
{
  "instruction": "Summarize this paper section into 5 points",
  "input": "Deep learning models have revolutionized natural language processing through the use of transformer architectures...",
  "response": "1. Deep learning models using transformer architectures have transformed natural language processing capabilities.\n2. The attention mechanism enables models to selectively focus on important parts of input sequences.\n..."
}
```

## LoRA Training Configuration

### Model Selection Rationale

**Base Model Options**:

1. **GPT-2** (Development/Testing)
   - Parameters: 117M
   - Advantages: Fast training, CPU compatible
   - Use case: Local development and testing

2. **Microsoft Phi-2** (Recommended)
   - Parameters: 2.7B
   - Advantages: Strong performance, moderate resources
   - Use case: Production deployment with GPU

3. **LLaMA-2 7B** (High Performance)
   - Parameters: 7B
   - Advantages: State-of-the-art quality
   - Use case: Research or high-resource environments

### LoRA Hyperparameters

**Chosen Configuration**:
```python
LoraConfig(
    r=8,                    # Rank: Balance between efficiency and expressiveness
    lora_alpha=32,          # Alpha: 4x rank for stable training
    target_modules=[        # Target modules: Core attention components
        "q_proj", "v_proj", 
        "k_proj", "o_proj"
    ],
    lora_dropout=0.05,      # Dropout: Light regularization
    bias="none",            # Bias: No bias adaptation
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM
)
```

**Rationale for Hyperparameters**:

- **Rank (r=8)**: Provides sufficient capacity for task adaptation while keeping training efficient
- **Alpha (32)**: Standard 4x rank ratio ensures stable gradient scaling
- **Target Modules**: Focus on attention mechanisms which are crucial for text understanding
- **Dropout (0.05)**: Conservative regularization to prevent overfitting on small dataset

### Training Parameters

**Recommended Settings**:
```python
TrainingArguments(
    num_train_epochs=3,              # Conservative to prevent overfitting
    learning_rate=2e-4,              # Standard LoRA learning rate
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,   # Memory efficient
    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,    # Effective batch size = 8
    warmup_steps=100,                # Gradual warmup
    save_steps=500,                  # Regular checkpointing
    eval_steps=500,                  # Regular evaluation
    fp16=True,                       # Mixed precision training
    optim="adamw_torch",             # Stable optimizer
    weight_decay=0.01                # Light regularization
)
```
